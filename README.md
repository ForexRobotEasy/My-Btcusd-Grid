## Description

The My Btcusd Grid EA is an automated trading system designed to trade the BTC/USD currency pair using a grid trading strategy. It aims to profit from the volatility and price fluctuations of the BTC/USD market.

## How It Works

The EA uses the MQL5 programming language and the MetaTrader platform to execute trades. It employs a grid trading strategy, which involves placing buy and sell orders at predetermined price levels, known as grid levels. The EA buys at grid levels and sets a target profit and stop loss for each trade. It also sells at grid levels, again with a target profit and stop loss.

The grid levels are calculated based on the current price of the BTC/USD pair. The EA determines the current price and then calculates the grid levels by adding or subtracting a fixed increment (symbol point) from the current price.

The EA executes a series of buy and sell orders at the grid levels to take advantage of price movements. The lot size, target profit, and stop loss can be customized using the defined constants in the code.

The EA is designed to be run on the MetaTrader platform and is triggered on each new tick of the chart. It checks if grid trading is enabled and if there are no open trades. If these conditions are met, it calculates the grid levels and executes the buy and sell orders at the grid levels.
